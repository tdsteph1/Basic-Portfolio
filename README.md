# Overview
In this assignment, you'll build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. These instructions include a short style guide; follow it to design an aesthetically pleasing layout while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements.

# Instructions
Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following: 



3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.


In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
In the css folder, make a file called reset.css, and include the code found from the Meyerweb reset located here.
In the images folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image, the placeholder images for the portfolio, and the social icon images).





Push the above changes to GitHub. 



Make sure to git add . and git commit -m "initial site files". Then type git push origin master to push your changes to your GitHub repo.
